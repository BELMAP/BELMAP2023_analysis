## 10.1 Residue monitoring in the environment {#paragraph91}

The environment is increasingly acknowledged as a contributor to the
development and spread of AMR [[70]](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6651), in particular in high risk areas due to
human, animal , agriculture and manufacturing waste streams. All Belgian
regions adhere to the European Directive 2008/105/CE on environmental
quality standards in the field of water policy. The Vlaamse
Milieumaatschappij (VMM), Brussels Environment and the Service Public de
Wallonie (SPW) track the concentration of potential water pollutants of
surface water listed in the European Watch List (Figure 50). The most
recent version of this list
[[71]](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/NL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022D1307)
contains four antibiotics: sulfamethoxazol, trimethoprim, clindamycine
and ofloxacine. Previous watch lists included amoxicilline and
ciprofloxacine (2019-2022), and three macrolides (erythromycin,
clarithromycin and azithromycin (2016-2020)). The report also defines
Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs)^[PNEC are based on their estimated minimal selective concentrations
    for selected bacterial species. The PNEC values can serve as a guide
    on the maximum levels of antibiotic residues in an environmental
    matrix, below which resistance is unlikely to develop.] and identifies possible
methods of analysis for the proposed substances.

Monitoring data for the five molecules of the 2016-2020 watch lists are
shown in Figure 51. All five molecules showed higher levels detected in
Brussels waterways in 2022. Of note, the PNEC of azithromycin (0.019
ug/L) is very close to the detection limit of current technology (0.02
ug/L). Regarding the new watch list, two molecules, trimethoprim and
sulfamethoxazole, were included in the monitoring program of 2022, with
monitoring of clindamycine and ofloxacine residues commencing in 2023.
Data from four sites in Flanders in 2022 showed higher levels of
sulfamethoxazol (mean value = 0.107 ug/L, max = 1.54 ug/L) compared to
trimethoprim (mean value = 0.018 ug/L, max = 0.073 ug/L), with only 3/36
measurements for sulfamethoxazol registering below the limit of
quantification (0.01 ug/L), compared to 13/36 for trimethoprim.

Apart from these mandatory monitoring, an encouraging number of point
prevalence studies and pilot projects have been initiated by the
regional authorities.

-   The IMHOTEP project (2018), performed in collaboration between the
    SPW and Brussels Environment (among other partners), investigated
    drug residues in water samples from effluents from purification
    stations, surface and drinking water; analyzing 208 samples in
    Wallonia and 50 samples in the Brussels Region
    [[72]](https://doi.org/10.2760/771124).\
-   The Interreg project DIADEM (2017--2020) mapped yearly fluctuations
    in residue concentration of 7 antibiotics in 24 sites spread
    alongside Meuse, Sambre and the Semois.\
-   The VMM published various reports on residues in surface and ground
    water[[73]](https://www.vmm.be/publicaties/veterinaire-antibiotica-in-water-2017-2018)\
-   The Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
    (ILVO, Instituut voor Landbouw-, Visserij- en Voedingsonderzoek) is
    participating in the PARRTAE project, which is a collaboration
    between several EU countries, involving the collection of water
    samples from sites with suspected high and low loads of antibiotic
    residues (see section 11.3.2 for further details)

## 10.2 Antifungal pesticide use in the environment {#paragraph92}

Pesticides encompass a wide range of products designed to prevent,
repel, destroy or mitigate unwanted organisms, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. As such, antimicrobial (especially fungicidal and bactericidal) products aren't
just used to treat infections of humans and animals, but also to treat
or prevent infections in agricultural produce such as grains, fruit and
vegetables. Pesticide use is important for protecting agricultural
productivity, with fungal pathogens alone destroying an estimated 1/3 of
global crop production annually
[[74]](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10947). However, there are concerns
that the use of such products in the environment may drive resistance as
the broad application of pesticides to, for example, an entire field
exposes a very wide diversity of microorganisms to the pesticide at
potentially very variable concentrations. The potential impact of the
use of pesticides on AMR development and the risk this poses to the
effectiveness of human and veterinary treatments remains unclear, but is
particularly concerning when the drugs used in the environment are very
similar, or even the same, as those used in medical practice.

FAOSTAT provides data relating to food and agriculture for over 245
countries and territories, including Belgium
[[75]](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RP). This data source
provides consumption data, expressed in tonnes of active product, for a
number of pesticides used in the agricultural sector for crops, seeds and forestry. Below we
illustrate the volume (in tonnes) of diazole and triazole antifungal
chemicals utilised in the Belgian agricultural sector (crops, seeds and forestry, light blue),
compared to the volume consumed in the human medical sector (dark blue).
Azoles (including diazoles and triazoles) are the most widely used class
of molecules in human antifungal therapy
[[76]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2016.11.019). Only five classes of
antifungal medications have been developed, with multiple displaying
high toxicity or limited oral availability (thus requiring
hospitalisation and intravenous treatment), leaving few alternatives for
treating resistant fungal pathogens
[[77]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-022-00720-1).

### 10.3.1 Monitoring of azole-resistance in *A. fumigatus* in wastewater samples {#subparagraph91}

-Hanne Debergh and Ann Packeu, Sciensano

Environmental azole resistance monitoring of *A. fumigatus* is not yet
embedded in an annual monitoring program as only now the interest in
this topic is rising. Environmental *A. fumigatus* monitoring is usually
performed through air and soil testing, however, in the research project
MissingLink, wastewater monitoring has been initiated. This research,
funded by Sciensano, investigates whether this medium could provide an
easier and more complete monitoring tool, that could be in relation with
monitoring in clinical isolates.

In 2021 and 2022, the first wastewater analysis have been performed
monitoring the presence of (azole resistant) *A. fumigatus*. In total,
10 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from Flanders and Brussels have
been selected, based on the highest population coverage (Figure 1).
Water filtrations have been performed using two media: malt +
chloramphenicol (MC) and MC supplemented with tebuconazole (4 mg/L) as a
first screening method for azole-resistance. This widely used
agricultural azole could potentially cause cross-resistance against
medical azoles. *A. fumigatus* has been detected at each sampling point,
with a total of 346 colonies isolated from the MC+T medium. A total of
14 isolates showed phenotypical resistance against at least one medical
azole (itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and isavuconazole)
resulting in a 4% prevalence rate, which is similar to what is seen in
clinical isolates in Belgium
[[78]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2021.08.024). Molecular testing
showed presence of the widely distributed TR34/L98H mutation and one
isolate carried the TR46/Y121F/T289A mutation.

The National Reference Centre (NRC) for mycoses receives around 600-700
human *A. fumigatus* isolates on a yearly basis. To be able to compare
the clinical resistance rates with environmental resistance rates in
Belgium, a new monitoring round was started in 2023 to increase the
number of isolates. We aim to test whether wastewater surveillance could

### 10.3.2 The PARRTAE project {#subparagraph92}

-Laurens Tuts, Geertrui Rasschaert, ILVO

The Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(ILVO) participates in the European PARRTAE project (2021-2024). This
consortium aims to study antibiotic resistance in the aquatic
environment, covering a wide variety of water samples, including
groundwater, surface water, wastewater plants and marine environments.
Water samples in regions with both low and high loads of antibiotic
usage will be collected. In addition, antibiotic residues will be
quantified, both in water and sediment. Another objective is the
determination of common ARG plasmids circulating in European waters in
order to understand and prevent their dissemination. In a first part of
this research, surface water and groundwater locations were chosen as
representatives for high-risk regions related to the use of antibiotics
in veterinary medicine. The spread of manure on arable lands can lead to
the dissemination of the antibiotic (resistance) load into the
environment. Suspecting a high load of antibiotic residues and
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, samples were taken at 35 locations in
West-Flanders (Yser Basin) and 15 sites were sampled in Antwerp (Meuse
Basin), both for surface water (March 2022) and groundwater (Augustus to
December 2022). Additionally, a follow-up sampling of surface water was
conducted at the end of the fertilization period spanning from September
to November 2022. *E. coli* were isolated and tested for antibiotic
susceptibility. An increase in AMR (from 42% to 73%)
in *E. coli*, isolated from surface waters, was seen after the
fertilization period. In groundwater, there was a resistance in 67% of
samples. Resistance against sulfamethoxazole (50%) was most often
detected, followed by: ampicillin (22%), tetracycline (14%),
trimethoprim (14%) and ciprofloxacin (6%). ESBL-producing *E. coli* were isolated in 29 samples (29%).
Remarkable for these ESBL *E. coli* was the occurrence of resistance
against ertapenem (15%), colistin (4%) and 3rd & 4th generation
cephalosporins. Antibiotic residues will be quantified to possibly
associate the occurrence of antibiotic resistance with the presence of
antibiotics in water. In marine samples, antibiotic susceptibility will
later be assessed in the indicator organisms *Vibrio* spp. and *Shewanella*
spp.
